# Zero-Wire

This repository contains source materials the Zero-Wire project, as detailed in the following paper.

Jonathan Oostvogels, Fan Yang, Sam Michiels, and Danny Hughes. 2020. Zero-Wire: A Deterministic and Low-Latency Wireless Bus Through Symbol-Synchronous Transmission of Optical Signals. In *The 18th ACM Confer- ence on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys ’20), November 16– 19, 2020, Virtual Event, Japan*.

We would like to encourage follow-up research on this project and therefore make the corresponding source materials available to interested parties. While parts of these materials are still subject to pending patent claims, interested parties can request access to the Zero-Wire implementation by contacting [jonathan.oostvogels@cs.kuleuven.be](mailto:jonathan.oostvogels@cs.kuleuven.be). For details on the DenseVLC hardware platform, we refer to [that platform's webpage](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/telemic/research/NetworkedSystems/infrastructure/IoT-Lab/vlc-lab/visible-light-communication-testbed).
